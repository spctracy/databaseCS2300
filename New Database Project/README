Basic files were implemented for classes, assignments, group-study, awards and settings
Ran out of time for the ambitions that I had

Currently running index.html file will open the login.html, any username or password
will take you to the main page

Currently working is the canvas, which you can draw, and erase, and take a screenshot ones work

Wanted to implement a file system to save the respective screenshots to the classes but ran out of time

## Current Features

 - user authentication
 -Role-based access
 -Personal Dashboard
 -Sections pages
 -admin dashboard
 -canvas drawing
 -live date display

 ## Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v16 or later) and **npm**  
- **MySQL** server (or Docker & DockerÂ Compose)  
- (Optional) **Docker** for containerized setup  

---

## Installation & Setup
    Install file folders containing all of the files
    To include New Database Project and below

## Install Dependenices - IN BASH
    npm install

Root file created === .env

Database already created using db-init.js

## MYSQL - Importing schemas/updating
    -**IN BASH**
    - mysql -u planner_user -p planner_db < sql/schema.sql
    - mysql -u planner_user -p planner_db < sql/data.sql

## Start
    'npm start'
    'npm run dev'

## Start (if npm is not working properly)
    once file has been downloaded, locate 'public' folder, go to index file, then open with live server, or show preview, if vscode is being used

    If not, attempt to run node server.js to get it to run the file then log in to the below http address. All steps should be the same to follow

## Access
    Once the server has started running on local host, should look like
    ''
    Go into your browser and enter 'http://localhost:3000/login.html'

    The database is populated with random information, but to access the admin page

    ** Admin Page **
        login as 'bob'
        password = '654321'
        go into dev tools, then open admin.html under public

## Dashboard
    Admin dashboard does not currently have any features attached to it. If features were implemented, they would have access to student data, such as classes and assignments.

## Finish
    Once file has actually started running explore the features of it, I currently do not have a lot of the database features currently linked to the planner other than being able to login in under admin as 'bob'
